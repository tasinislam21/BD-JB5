# BD-JB5

PS5 Blu-ray Disc Java Sandbox Escape.  
Supporting RemoteJarLoader, On-Screen Logging and Network Logging.  

### Supported upto 13.42 firmware.  

RemoteLogger server is listening on port 18194.  
Use log_client.py to get the log.  
I recommend running `log_client.py` first, then starting the BD-J app.  

RemoteJarLoader server is listening on port 9025.  
Use jar_client.py to send the jar file.  
You can use any other TCP payload sender too.  
Don't forget to set `Main-Class` in `manifest.txt`.  

## To use at 13.60 and higher firmware
**Note : YOU NEED ALREADY JAILBROKEN PS5**

Send `bdj_unpatch.elf` to elfldr to unpatch BD-J.  
`bdj_unpatch.elf` will backup existing `bdjstack.jar` to `bdjstack.jar.bak` just in case.  

Now you will be able to use BD-JB.  

**DO NOT REINSTALL FW, IT WILL WIPE THE PATCH AND LOSE BD-JB**
